/* GAME LOGIC SECTION
Im laying out the named functions in order of their use across the games timeline, and trying to name them sematically. ie: theWoods1, theWoods2, ticTacToe, etc.
Below here, is my idea of mechanics more fleshed out. 

The pattern is prety simple (fingers crossed!):  
    1. Declare the functions list of actions.
    2. Write the function that reacts to the target button being pressed.
    3. Repeat
    4. Drink a beer.
